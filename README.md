# ml-framework
This framework is supports _ algorithms from which I recreated from scratch with nothing but numpy. These algorithms were originally 'hacked' together in jupyter notebooks as a form of solidifying what my machine learning studies (see below for notebooks). This framework took those algorithms, cleaned them up, and put them into a well-designed framework allowing for expansion and ease of use by the user. 

## Algorithms Included 
### - Linear Regression:
  - OLS (Closed Form)
  - OLS (Open Form - basic gradient descent)
  - OLS (Open Form - coordinate descent)
  - OLS w/ L2 Regularization (Closed Form)
  - OLS w/ L2 Regularization (Open Form)
  - OLS w/ L1 Regularization (Open Form - Coordinate Descent)

### --Logistic Regression

### - Softmax Regression

### - Kmeans:
  - Elkan's Optimization
  - Brute Force

### - KNN:
  - KNN Regressor
    - Weighted
    - Heap Based
  - KNN Classififer
    - Weighted
    - Heap Based

### - Decision Trees (Integration In Progress)
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Decision Tree Classifier

### - Linearly Separable SVM (Integration & Bug Fix in Progress)
